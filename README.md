# Z50-SSD: Solid-State Disk Controller for the Z50Bus


## Introduction

This project implements a solid-state disk controller for the [LiNC Z50Bus](http://linc.no/products/z50bus/).  It is based on the [z80_ssd](https://github.com/hharte/z80_ssd) and utilizes the same firmware.  The only difference between the z80_ssd and the Z50-SSD is the physical board layout and connector.
